# **Newsfeed Analytics in Tableau**

## **Overview**
This project involves a Newsfeed Analysis for the 365 platform using Tableau, providing hands-on experience with optimizing a websiteâ€™s newsfeed feature to enhance user engagement. By analyzing real user interaction data, this analysis aims to derive insights that will help inform design improvements, drive engagement, and ultimately contribute to increased course subscriptions and renewals.

## **Objective**
The primary goal of this analysis is to visualize and interpret user interaction patterns with the Newsfeed service on the 365 platform over a five-month period, from **January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2023**. This includes generating various visualizations to showcase crucial findings, focusing on:
- User preferences for **automated vs. manual posts**
- Interaction trends that highlight potential improvements to the Newsfeed feature

## **Project Challenge**
The Newsfeed feature serves as a real-time content stream that updates with new posts to keep users engaged. It includes:
- **Automated posts**, which highlight user milestones (e.g., completing an award or earning a certificate)
- **Manual posts**, which allow users to share their insights or opinions with the community

The challenge of this analysis is to identify which post types (automated or manual) resonate more with users and to detect any potential issues in the engagement patterns that can be addressed to optimize the Newsfeed experience. Through this, we aim to foster a more active online community that encourages users to return, engage, and invest in the platform.

## **Analysis & Insights**
Using Tableau, we created multiple dashboards and visualizations that analyze key metrics, including:
- **Engagement levels for automated vs. manual posts**
- **User interaction patterns** across various times and post types
- **User feedback loops** and engagement growth over time

These insights provide recommendations to refine the Newsfeed's structure, such as focusing on more engaging content formats, adjusting the timing of post updates, and enhancing user visibility of milestone achievements. 

## **Solution**
You can view the Tableau dashboard with interactive visualizations and key findings [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mohith.saran/viz/newsfeed_analysis_17304614328350/NewsFeedAnalysisDashBoard?publish=yes).

## **Key Findings**
- **Preference for Automated Posts**: Users showed higher engagement with automated posts that highlight milestones, suggesting these updates are motivational and widely appreciated within the community.
- **Time-Based Engagement Patterns**: Certain times of day/week saw higher engagement rates, indicating optimal posting times for new content.
- **Opportunities for Enhanced Interaction**: There is potential to increase the reach and impact of manual posts by integrating prompts or community-driven discussion points.

## **Recommendations**
Based on the insights derived, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. **Boost Milestone Visibility**: Increase the frequency or prominence of milestone posts, as these drive substantial user engagement.
2. **Optimize Posting Times**: Schedule more content around peak engagement times identified in the analysis.
3. **Encourage Community Interaction**: Develop prompts for manual posts to facilitate richer interactions, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.

## **Conclusion**
This Newsfeed Analytics project highlights the importance of data-driven optimization for user engagement. Through strategic adjustments to the content and posting structure, the 365 platform can create a more dynamic and community-focused environment, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and retention.
